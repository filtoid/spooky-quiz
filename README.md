This quiz engine uses PyGame so make sure you have PyGame installed then simply run ```python main.py``` to get it running.

This code is provided as is and can be used for literally anything you want, you can even sell it commercially. The only caveat is that nobody takes any responsibility for anything whatsoever. If you poke your eye out with it you are on your own!
